## 📊 Project Highlights

### 📊 SQL Analysis
SQL scripts are organized by year and month pairs:

- *2023*
  - jan-march/ → Sales and discount analysis for Jan–Mar 2023
  - may-june/ → Sales and discount analysis for May–Jun 2023
  - oct-nov/ → Sales and discount analysis for Oct–Nov 2023
- *2024*
  - jan-march/ → Sales and discount analysis for Jan–Mar 2024
  - may-june/ → Sales and discount analysis for May–Jun 2024
  - oct-nov/ → Sales and discount analysis for Oct–Nov 2024
 
### 🔹 Power BI
The *Power BI dashboards* provide:
- *Top 10 suppliers by total sales* (YoY comparison)
- *Total sales & quantity* YoY for each period
- Dynamic visual insights into supplier and product performance

### 🐍 Python Analysis
The *Python notebooks* complement Power BI by:
- Performing sales trend analysis using *Pandas & Matplotlib*
- Calculating YoY growth percentages and top-performing products
- Exporting charts for LinkedIn and business reports

### PowerPoint Presentations
This folder contains professional presentations with conclusions and recommendations for:
- January–March 2024
- May–June 2024
- October–November 2024

Each presentation summarizes the SQL and Python analysis and is ready to share with stakeholders or clients.

*Key analyses:*
1. Top suppliers by total sales and discount percentage  
2. Top 10 products by sales value and quantity sold  
3. Products with highest growth and decline percentages  
4. Monthly comparisons (Jan vs Mar, May vs Jun, Oct vs Nov)  

*Python Visualizations*
- Bar charts for top product groups  
- Sales evolution vs quantity sold  

*Power BI Dashboards*
- Interactive sales trends by month and supplier  
- Discount impact on net sales  
- Key KPIs for management
